### Notes Assets Folder

- This is for other asset files that are added manually outside from site builder e.g Webflow

  - '~/public/assets/images' -> site.com/assets/images/\*
  - '~/public/assets/fonts' -> site.com/assets/fonts/\*
  - '~/public/assets/css' -> site.com/assets/css/\*

- Site builder files should have the public as as the root e.g
  - '~/public/images' -> site.com/images/\*
  - '~/public/fonts' -> site.com/fonts/\*
  - '~/public/css' -> site.com/css/\*
